                    The robotics club at the <strong> Army Institute of Technology, Pune</strong> is the hub of all prime activities concerned with robotic engineering, experiential designing, R&D and automation.
        
                </p>
                <p>
                    We, as a club, work continuously towards achieving and raising the bar of our mission of providing a unique, challenging learning environment that would inspire young minds to apply and sharpen their STEM skills; maintaining constant pace with learning the concepts of embedded and IoT systems
                </p>
                <p>
                    The events, workshops and seminars conducted by the club aim at ensuring sustained use of robotics along with soliciting innovative ideas from students to real problems
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since its introduction in  , the robotics club has made its presence felt not only at the institute or state level but also at national and international level competitions. The core team members work relentlessly day and night to provide a platform for individuals/teams to showcase their innovative projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having undertaken 27 years of journey as a successful club, we wish to carry forward the legacy with much more enthusiasm and hardwork.
